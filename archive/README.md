## Download the Code
There are three starter projects for Session 2 located on GitHub. GitHub is a tool used for developing and publishing code that is popular with programmers. If you want to further your programming education you may consider setting up an account.

A zip file containing all three scripts is located [in the code folder](code). Download the zip file and extract the scripts to a location you can easily find them in the next step.

## Open Visual Studio Code and Project Files
1. Launch Visual Studio Code (VSCode) on your computer.
2. Go to File > Open and choose the Project1.py file.
3. Go to File > Open and choose the Project2.java file.
4. Go to File > Open and choose the Project3.r file.
